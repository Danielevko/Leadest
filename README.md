# Introduction
This project aims to develop a recommendation system for the automotive and leasing industry. The current method of sale in this industry is considered outdated and the project aims to address the issues with this method by simplifying the process of converting leads to sales and increasing company profit.

# Description
The system is designed to rank leads according to their likelihood of conversion to a sale and includes a dynamic dashboard for data analysis. The system uses two different machine learning methods: supervised and unsupervised learning. After uploading a leads file, the data is filtered, prepared, and processed. The unsupervised algorithm then divides the leads into four groups: hot, high, medium, and low. The next time the system is used, supervised algorithms are activated to learn which leads have converted to a sale.

The system is interactive, with the user receiving emails and storing data in a cloud using Google's API. The project was developed using Python as the programming language and SQLite as the database. Client-side development languages are combined with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with the Bootstrap and Flask libraries. A built-in lead file was used for testing, simulating real-world leasing conditions.

# Future Development
The future developments for the system include improving its accuracy and expanding the scope of industries it can be applied to.

# Usage
It's a project which is build for Car Leasing Companies, as it help them to have a more efficient way to convert leads to sales, also the dynamic dashboard helps the managers to have better insight into the leads, this will in return increase the company's profit.

# Conclusion

This project was developed to improve the efficiency of converting leads to sales in the automotive and leasing industry. The recommendation system, utilizing machine learning methods, is able to rank leads according to their likelihood of conversion to a sale. The dynamic dashboard allows managers to have better insights into the leads, ultimately increasing the company's profit.

It's worth mentioning that with the use of this system and its algorithms we have reached 83% success rate in prediction of sales leads which is quite a remarkable achievement.

We believe that this system can be a valuable asset for car leasing companies, and we hope that this README has provided a clear overview of the project and its potential uses. If you have any further questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
